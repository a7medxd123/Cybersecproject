Vulnerability Findings :
1. SQL Injection in Login Page (Critical)
i. Description, risk, and potential impact:
SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate backend SQL queries by injecting malicious inputs into user fields. This can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or even full database compromise.
Potential impact:
Unauthorized access to sensitive user data such as credentials, PII, or financial records.
Potential for privilege escalation and control over the database or application.
ii. Evidence:
Proof of Concept:
Injected payload: admin' OR '1'='1 into the login form, bypassing authentication.
Screenshot: Displays successful login to an admin account without valid credentials.
Log snippet: Shows SQL query manipulated to bypass checks (SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1' AND password='...').
iii. Remediation steps:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs to reject malicious patterns.
Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block injection attempts.
Regularly conduct code reviews and use static analysis tools to identify SQLi risks.
2. Access Log (Sensitive Data Exposure) (Critical)
i. Description, risk, and potential impact:
Access logs were found to contain sensitive information, such as API keys, session tokens, or internal IP addresses. Exposure of this data can enable attackers to perform lateral movement, session hijacking, or unauthorized API usage.
Potential impact:
Compromise of API keys could lead to misuse of backend services.
Attackers may gain insight into application infrastructure and operational behavior.
ii. Evidence:
Screenshot: 
Log snippet: GET /ftb.
iii. Remediation steps:
Remove or exclude sensitive information from log entries.
Secure log files with strict access controls and encryption.
Review logging configurations to ensure adherence to privacy and security guidelines.
Implement automated log monitoring tools to detect and alert on anomalous activities.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Search (Critical)
i. Description, risk, and potential impact:
XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages. These scripts execute in the context of other users, leading to session hijacking, phishing, or data theft.
Potential impact:
Theft of session cookies could result in unauthorized access to user accounts.
Malicious scripts may redirect users to phishing sites or inject trojans.
ii. Evidence:
Proof of Concept:
Payload: <iframe src="javascript:alert(xss)"> injected into the product search bar, causing an alert box to appear for other users viewing the page.
Screenshot: Alert box displaying on a victimâ€™s browser.
Network trace: Confirms execution of injected malicious payload.
iii. Remediation steps:
Sanitize and validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.
Use output encoding techniques to render input as plain text instead of executable code.
Deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script execution.
Conduct regular security testing to identify and patch XSS vulnerabilities.
4. Broken Access Control (Critical)
i. Description:
Broken access control occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users can access are improperly enforced. This can allow unauthorized users or attackers to gain access to sensitive data or restricted functionalities.
Potential impact:
Unauthorized access to sensitive information or administrative functions.
Potential for privilege escalation, allowing attackers to perform actions beyond their intended permissions.
ii. Evidence:
Proof of Concept:
Direct access to admin-only pages via URL manipulation without proper authentication.
Bypassed restrictions using forged requests or tokens.
Screenshot: Displays unauthorized access to an admin page.
Log entry: Shows access granted to a non-privileged user with manipulated HTTP requests.
iii. Remediation steps:
Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only access permitted resources.
Validate user permissions on the server side for every request, regardless of client-side checks.
Use secure session management techniques to prevent token manipulation or reuse.
Regularly test for access control flaws using automated tools and manual penetration testing.
